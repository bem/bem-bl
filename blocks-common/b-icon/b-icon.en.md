This is an abstract container for an icon.

The block has optional attributes: `alt`, `url`, `width`, `height`.

Set property `url#` to make **b-icon** with another image. The same for attributes `alt`, `width` and `height`.

It is possible to use css sprites and single images for the block by using css-property `background: url(...);`
