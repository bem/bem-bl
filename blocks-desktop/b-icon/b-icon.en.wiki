This is an abstract container for an icon.

By default the block produces a tag ##img## which has an one-pixel transparent image (.gif) and an empty attribute "alt".

The block has optional attributes: ##alt, url, width, height##.

Set property ##url# to make ##b-icon## with another image. The same for attributes ##alt, width## and ##height##.

It is possible to use css sprites and single images for the block by using css-property ##background: url(...);##
