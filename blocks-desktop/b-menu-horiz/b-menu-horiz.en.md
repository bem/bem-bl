A **b-menu-horiz** block provides a horizontal menu. The block also has functionality (implemented on JavaScript) that helps to write scripts with reaction on a menu item when becoming selected.

HTML markup complexity depends on a block modifier.

The block has a `layout` modifier with three following values:

 * `horiz`
 * `complex`
 * `normal`

**Attention**: This block cannot be used without a `layout` modifier.
